
1. Agent Coordination & File Ownership
Rule: Only the designated agent may modify their own sync log file (CASCADE_SYNC.md, ORION_SYNC.md, VEGA_SYNC.md).
Rule: When a file is marked ready for synchronization, only the assigned sync agent may edit, move, or delete it until the handoff is complete.
Rule: Agents must check all other sync logs before starting work or syncing files.
2. Checklist and Documentation Consistency
Rule: All new tasks and subtasks in DESIGN_PLAN.md must have unique, never-reused IDs.
Rule: No feature may be checked off in the high-level list unless all its subtasks are checked and documentation is up to date.
Rule: Any change to the checklist or design plan must be reflected in the coordination folder and communicated via sync logs.
3. Branching & Version Control
Rule: All development must occur on the dev branch; only stable, reviewed work may be merged to master.
Rule: No direct pushes to master are allowed.
Rule: All agents must commit and push early and often, with clear commit messages referencing checklist IDs.
4. Linting, Testing, and Quality
Rule: Markdown linting must pass before merging or marking documentation tasks as complete.
Rule: All code changes must include or reference relevant tests (unit, integration, or playmode as appropriate).
Rule: Security and quality concerns raised in sync logs must be addressed before merging.
5. UI/UX and Accessibility
Rule: Each agent’s window should use a unique color theme and show the agent name prominently (if supported by Windsurf).
Rule: All UI changes should be reviewed for clarity and accessibility.
6. General Collaboration
Rule: No agent may modify another agent’s sync log or work files directly.
Rule: All communication and handoffs must be documented in the appropriate sync log.
Rule: Agents should strive to minimize file overlap and design features for maximum parallelism.
7. Optional: Custom Lint/Pre-Commit Hooks
Rule: Local pre-commit hooks should warn on markdown lint errors and block direct pushes to master.
