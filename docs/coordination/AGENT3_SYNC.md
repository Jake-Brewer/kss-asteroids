# Agent3 Sync Log

## Instructions
- Only Agent3 writes to this file. Others may read.
- Each entry is prepended with a timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
- Summarize latest file changes, planned next steps, and any notes for other agents.
- Once a file is marked ready for synchronization, Agent3 becomes the owner and is responsible for deleting it after sync or leaving a message in their own sync file if further edits are needed.
