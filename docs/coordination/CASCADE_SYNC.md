# Cascade Agent Sync Log

## Instructions
- Only Cascade writes to this file. Other agents may read.
- Each entry is prepended with a timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
- Summarize latest file changes, planned next steps, and any notes for other agents.
- Remove entries once the owner agent confirms changes are incorporated into parent docs.

**To Orion and Vega:**

I'm proposing a streamlined workflow based on recent discussions and user suggestions:

- We will experiment with a shared `STATUS_BOARD.md` for session/milestone summaries. Each agent edits only their own section.
- File handoffs will be tracked via the status board and sync logs, but not require moving files unless necessary.
- GitHub Issues/Projects, Trello, or Jira may replace the status board if we find them more effective. Please share your thoughts.
- If we move to feature branches, each agent will work in their own branch and merge to dev when ready, fetching/merging latest dev before each merge.
- PRs should be reviewed by all three agents before merging to dev. PRs are always top priority.
- Responsibilities and personalities can be adjusted as needed for efficiency and project health.

**Please review these changes and leave feedback in your sync logs. Once both of you confirm understanding and agreement, I will update the coordination folder and workflow docs accordingly.**

**Consensus reached:** Both Orion and Vega have reviewed and approved the new workflow proposal. I will now finalize workflow documentation and update the coordination folder to reflect these changes. Agents should use STATUS_BOARD.md for milestone/session summaries and continue using sync logs for detailed handoff and coordination notes. Any migration to external tools will be documented in the checklist and design plan for traceability. Thank you for your collaboration.

**Update:** The workflow proposal is now reflected in STATUS_BOARD.md. User will be notified here and in the board of any process changes. Reminder to all agents: When making process changes, prompt the user to notify all agents to check for updates.

Progress: Resumed feature work on [F6] Ship & Asteroid Collision (lives system). No blockers. All agents are reminded to update their status after each session or major change, and to prompt the user to notify all agents if process changes occur.

2025-04-28 21:03:45

User Direction: Cascade to focus on coordination and implementation. Documentation, diagrams, and plan/status updates are delegated to Orion and Vega until all docs are caught up. Agent assignments for features, tasks, and subtasks will be suggested in STATUS_BOARD.md and/or DESIGN_PLAN.md for agents to pick up. Orion and Vega, please confirm receipt and begin catching up documentation and diagrams.

Cascade status update for agents and user:
- Cascade distributed work as follows: Orion is tasked with reviewing and updating all planning, requirements, and design documentation for accuracy, while Vega is responsible for supporting Orion and ensuring DESIGN_PLAN.md is always up to date and checked off as activities are completed. This enables parallel progress and cross-verification.
- Cascade is monitoring all agent activity, coordinating tasks, and preparing to begin implementation when documentation is ready.
- Vega has been specifically reminded to keep DESIGN_PLAN.md current and accurate.
- No blockers reported. All agents are encouraged to review and verify each other's changes.
