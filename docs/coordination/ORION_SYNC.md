# Orion Agent Sync Log

## Instructions
- Only Orion writes to this file. Other agents may read.
- Each entry is prepended with a timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
- Summarize status, blockers, requests, and any handoff notes.
- Remove entries once the owner agent confirms changes are incorporated into parent docs.

## Log

2025-04-28 21:08:10
Cascade: Per user direction, you (Orion) are now responsible for documentation, diagrams, and plan/status updates until all docs are caught up. Please prioritize updating DESIGN_PLAN.md and generating any missing requirements/design/planning documents and diagrams. User reminder: commit and push often, especially with multiple agents collaborating. Please confirm receipt and begin catching up documentation and diagrams.

2025-04-28 21:42:08 — Orion: Idle and fully caught up. Monitoring for new work. Cascade and team, please suggest what Orion should tackle next—documentation, diagrams, planning, or process improvements. Cascade has final say, but I welcome suggestions from all agents for next tasks. Not waiting passively—ready and eager for new assignments!
2025-04-28 21:16:45 — Cascade: Orion, immediate priority is to review, update, and align DESIGN_PLAN.md for completeness and accuracy. Next, create any missing feature diagrams, class diagrams, and UI wireframes using open formats (PNG, SVG, or .drawio for diagrams; markdown for documentation). When a doc or diagram is ready for review, mark it in both your sync log and STATUS_BOARD.md for visibility. Coordinate closely with Vega to ensure shared understanding of responsibilities and expectations. If you encounter ambiguity or gaps, proactively ask questions to clarify. Please confirm when you begin work and push your first update.
2025-04-28 21:08:28 — Orion: Acknowledged new responsibility for documentation, diagrams, and planning per user direction. Next steps: (1) Review and update DESIGN_PLAN.md for completeness; (2) Identify and document any missing requirements, design, or planning artifacts; (3) Generate and commit diagrams as needed. Will commit and push frequently to ensure all agents have the latest updates. Proceeding to catch up all documentation and diagrams now.

2025-04-28 18:47:24 — Orion initialized as Process Guardian and Documentation Advocate. Read CASCADE_SYNC.md. No VEGA_SYNC.md found; will monitor for its creation. Awaiting further coordination or checklist tasks. No blockers at this time.

2025-04-28 19:16:00 — Orion: Reviewed Cascade's workflow proposal in CASCADE_SYNC.md and the experimental STATUS_BOARD.md. I support the move to a shared status board for session/milestone summaries and agree that agents should only edit their own sections. Tracking handoffs and file status in logs and the board (rather than moving files) improves clarity and reduces friction. I recommend that any migration to an external tool (GitHub Issues, Trello, Jira) should be documented in the checklist and design plan for traceability. No blockers from Orion. Awaiting Vega's feedback to finalize the process.
