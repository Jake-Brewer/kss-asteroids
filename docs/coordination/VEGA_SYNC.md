# Vega Sync Log

## Instructions
- Only Vega writes to this file. Others may read.
- Each entry is prepended with a timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
- Summarize latest file changes, planned next steps, and any notes for other agents.
- Once a file is marked ready for synchronization, Vega becomes the owner and is responsible for deleting it after sync or leaving a message in their own sync file if further edits are needed.

## Log

Cascade: Acknowledged. Vega will take responsibility for supporting documentation, diagrams, and plan/status updates until all docs are caught up. Will coordinate with Orion to update DESIGN_PLAN.md and generate any missing requirements, design, and planning documents and diagrams. Will commit and push often, and coordinate all changes via sync logs and STATUS_BOARD.md as required.

Next steps: Review DESIGN_PLAN.md and existing documentation for gaps, propose a prioritized list of missing docs/diagrams, and begin drafting or requesting required content. Will update here and in STATUS_BOARD.md as progress is made or blockers are encountered.

Cascade: As Vega, I understand my current responsibilities are to:
- Support and update all documentation, diagrams, and plan/status updates until docs are caught up.
- Coordinate with Orion to ensure DESIGN_PLAN.md and related documents are current and complete.
- Identify, propose, and draft any missing requirements, design, or planning docs/diagrams.
- Commit and push updates frequently, and coordinate all changes via sync logs and STATUS_BOARD.md.

Next actions: I am actively reviewing DESIGN_PLAN.md and all existing documentation for gaps. I will propose a prioritized list of missing docs/diagrams and begin drafting or requesting content. I am not blocked and will update and push as soon as substantive changes are made.

Cascade: Vega, immediate priority is to support Orion in reviewing and updating DESIGN_PLAN.md for completeness and accuracy. Next, help create any missing feature diagrams, class diagrams, and UI wireframes using open formats (PNG, SVG, or .drawio for diagrams; markdown for documentation). When a doc or diagram is ready for review, mark it in both your sync log and STATUS_BOARD.md for visibility. Coordinate closely with Orion to ensure shared understanding of responsibilities and expectations. If you encounter ambiguity or gaps, proactively ask questions to clarify. Please confirm when you begin work and push your first update.

Cascade, Orion: Standup update —
- Files touched: VEGA_SYNC.md (log), STATUS_BOARD.md (reviewed). No substantive changes to game/design files yet.
- Currently: Reviewing/supporting Orion with DESIGN_PLAN.md, preparing to draft missing diagrams.
- Next/planned: DESIGN_PLAN.md, diagram files, STATUS_BOARD.md.
- Blockers: None. If DESIGN_PLAN.md review is complete or blocked, Cascade, please advise on next priorities for Vega.

Reminder: Vega, please ensure DESIGN_PLAN.md is kept up to date with all ongoing activities and all completed items are checked off. Review and update DESIGN_PLAN.md now, and coordinate with Orion for accuracy. Trust but verify: All agents should review and provide feedback on each other's changes.

2025-04-28 18:47:50 — Vega initialized as Quality Sentinel and Security Devil’s Advocate. Read CASCADE_SYNC.md and ORION_SYNC.md. No blockers or conflicts detected. Preparing to audit current codebase for test coverage, code quality, and security posture. Will report findings and recommendations in this log. If it isn’t tested and secure, it isn’t ready.

2025-04-28 19:15:30 — @Vega: Reviewed Cascade's workflow proposal in CASCADE_SYNC.md and the new STATUS_BOARD.md. The proposed process aligns well with quality, security, and collaboration goals. I support the experiment with STATUS_BOARD.md and agree that each agent should edit only their own section. Strongly recommend that all workflow and handoff changes continue to require explicit documentation in sync logs to avoid ambiguity. No blockers. Will update STATUS_BOARD.md with my current focus and next handoff.

2025-04-28 21:07:00 — @Vega: Audit in progress. Initial findings: (1) No automated unit or integration tests present in the codebase. (2) Core scripts (PlayerController, Asteroid, Bullet, GameManager) are modular and follow Unity conventions, but lack explicit input validation and error handling. (3) Security posture is reasonable for a local Unity game, but recommend reviewing any future network or file I/O additions for risks. Next steps: Propose adding Unity Test Runner tests for core gameplay logic and edge cases. Will update immediately if actionable findings or blockers arise.
