# Project Status Board (Experimental)

**Cascade is currently focused on coordination and implementation. Documentation, diagrams, and plan/status updates are delegated to Orion and Vega until all docs are caught up. Agent assignments for features, tasks, and subtasks will be suggested here and/or in DESIGN_PLAN.md for agents to pick up.**

This board is a shared summary of current focus, blockers, and handoff needs for each agent. Each agent edits only their own section. If we decide to switch to GitHub Issues/Projects or another tool, we will update this process.

## Cascade
- **Current Focus:** [2025-04-28 21:36:15] Cascade is monitoring and coordinating agent progress. Orion is focused on reviewing/updating all planning and design docs; Vega is supporting Orion and is now specifically reminded to keep DESIGN_PLAN.md up to date and checked off. Cascade will begin implementation once docs are ready.- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Commit minimal runnable application (window opens/closes)
  - [ ] Implement core game loop
  - [ ] Sync implementation with DESIGN_PLAN.md as it evolves
  - [ ] Communicate with Orion/Vega to resolve discrepancies
  - [ ] Resume feature implementation (ship, asteroids, collisions, etc.)
- **Blockers:** None
- **Next Handoff:** Will notify agents and user if major process changes or blockers occur.

## Orion
- **Current Focus:** [2025-04-28 21:14:09] Reviewing and updating DESIGN_PLAN.md for completeness, identifying/documenting missing requirements, design elements, and diagrams. Awaiting further input from Cascade/Vega but will proceed if no blockers are raised.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Review DESIGN_PLAN.md for gaps/accuracy
  - [ ] Update requirements/design/planning docs
  - [ ] Draft and commit feature/class/UI diagrams
  - [ ] Mark ready-for-review docs/diagrams in sync log and STATUS_BOARD.md
  - [ ] Coordinate with Vega on documentation standards
- **Blockers:** None

## Vega
- **Current Focus:** [2025-04-28 21:13:15] Supporting Orion in DESIGN_PLAN.md review, reviewing all documentation for gaps, and preparing to propose a prioritized list of missing docs/diagrams. Will proceed with drafting if no blockers are raised.
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Review DESIGN_PLAN.md and other docs for gaps
  - [ ] Propose prioritized list of missing docs/diagrams
  - [ ] Draft and commit feature/class/UI diagrams
  - [ ] Mark ready-for-review docs/diagrams in sync log and STATUS_BOARD.md
  - [ ] Coordinate with Orion on documentation standards
- **Blockers:** None

## Unassigned Items
- [ ] Add Unity UI elements for score/lives/game over ([F9.1])
- [ ] Implement sound effects ([F10.1], [F10.2])
- [ ] Visual polish: sprites/particles ([F11.1], [F11.2])
- [ ] Complete CI automation tasks ([A2]–[A9])
- [ ] Generate and commit all required diagrams ([D1]–[D3])
- [ ] Add and document test scripts ([A9], [L1]–[L5])
- [ ] Update CREDITS.txt for asset attribution
- [ ] Any new features/subtasks as added in DESIGN_PLAN.md

### Project Status (Detailed, Low-Level)
- **[2025-04-28 21:28:10]**
  - Cascade is preparing to commit a minimal application window (first runnable build) and will then proceed with core gameplay features.
  - Orion and Vega are actively reviewing and updating DESIGN_PLAN.md and supporting docs, with a focus on identifying/documenting all requirements and diagrams.
  - No blockers reported. All agents are encouraged to update this status section and their checklists after each major change, so this document will reflect steady, incremental progress.

## Orion
- **Current Focus:** Maintaining checklist and documentation consistency. Ensuring all new tasks/subtasks have unique IDs and that DESIGN_PLAN.md reflects latest feature progress. Supporting the transition to the new workflow.
- **Blockers:** None
- **Next Handoff:** Will update user and agents if documentation or checklist protocol changes.

## Vega
- **Current Focus:** Auditing the codebase for test coverage, code quality, and security posture. Reviewing workflow and coordination changes for clarity and alignment with quality/security goals.
- **Blockers:** None
- **Next Handoff:** Will report audit findings and recommendations in VEGA_SYNC.md and coordinate with Cascade for any required actions.
