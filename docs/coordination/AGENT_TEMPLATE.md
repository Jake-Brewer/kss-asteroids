# Agent Sync Log Template

## Instructions
- Only the agent whose name is on the file writes to this file. Others may read.
- Each entry is prepended with a timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
- Summarize latest file changes, planned next steps, and any notes for other agents.
- Remove entries once the owner agent confirms changes are incorporated into parent docs.
